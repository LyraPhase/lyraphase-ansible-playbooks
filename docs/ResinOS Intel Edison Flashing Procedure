ResinOS Intel Edison Flashing Procedure
=======================================

1. Download ResinOS `dev` image from resin.io
2. Unzip files to a temporary directory:

        `unzip -d /tmp/resin-resin2edisontest-2.0.5+rev1-dev-v4.2.2 ~/Downloads/resin-resin2edisontest-2.0.5+rev1-dev-v4.2.2.zip`

3. `chmod +x ./flashall.sh && ./flashall.sh`
4. Wait for flashing process to complete
5. Connect to serial console via `bloop c` or screen
6. `systemctl stop ModemManager`
7. If above step fails, either:
  - Wait for Edison to come up on the network & SSH in, then issue command
  - Or unplug & re-plug board, reconnect to serial console, login as `root` & manually type fast `systemctl stop ModemManager` (may take a couple tries... ignore the weird characters being spit onto the console.. those are from ModemManager which we are trying to disable)
7. Completely disable ModemManager from future boots:

        mount -o remount,rw /
        systemctl disable ModemManager
        systemctl mask ModemManager
        systemctl reboot
